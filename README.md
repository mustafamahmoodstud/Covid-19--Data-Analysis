# COVID-19-Data-Analyisis using Python
# Dataset
The data for this project is taken from Kaggle. The data contains 5 columns — Date, State, Cured, Deaths, Confirmed. The table used for this analysis contains data from the beginning of the Pandemic till 24th June 2020.
The project contains an in-depth analysis of Covid Cases, implemented using Python.
# Introduction
Python is a highly powerful general-purpose programming language that can be easily learned and provides data scientists a wide variety of tools and packages. Amid this pandemic period, I decided to analyze this novel coronavirus.
In this article, I am going to walk you through the steps I undertook for this analysis with visuals and code snippets.
# Steps involved in Data Analysis:
Step — 1: Importing required Packages
Importing our required packages is the starting point of all data analysis programming in python. As I’ve said, python provides a wide variety of packages for data scientists and in this analysis, I used python’s most popular data science packages Pandas and NumPy for Data Wrangling and EDA. When coming to Data Visualization, I used python’s interactive packages Plotly and Matplotlib. It’s very simple to import packages in python code:
Step — 2: Gathering Data
For a clean and perfect data analysis, the foremost important element is collecting quality Data. For this analysis, I’ve collected many data from various sources for better accuracy.
Step — 3: Data Wrangling
Data Wrangling is a process where we will transform and clean our data to our needs. We can’t analyze with our raw extracted data. So, we have to transform the data to proceed with our analysis.
Step — 4: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
This process is quite long as it is the heart and soul of data analysis.
